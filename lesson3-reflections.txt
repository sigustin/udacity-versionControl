When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you want to work from several computer, access your repo from another place with other device or simply when you want to work wth other people on the project
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   Because there could be code that's been added to GitHub that would be conflicting with the code your currently woring, so you might want to have your code finished
   before worrying about code integration in the newest versions. Plus, it's rather annoying to see the code around you change while you're working.
